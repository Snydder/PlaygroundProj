## [PlaygroundProj](https://github.com/matheusperches/PlaygroundProj)

#### Personal Unreal Engine 4 project of a six degrees of freedom spaceship.

#### Main features

- A customizable in-engine boost pool system that increases thrust when pressed and depletes over time.

- A customizable in-engine flight model that is based of a simplified cube. The PhysicsThruster engine feature is used to move and rotate the ship.

- Decoupled rotation and translation by default.

- A time attack gamemode to test your flight skills with checkpoints that add a small amount of time. 

- A basic HUD with a third person view

- Basic thruster VFX.

#### Learnings
- Learned how to use the UE4 editor

- Learned about Blueprints and C++ coding 

- Had to chase and implement a lot of solutions by myself as this is an unique project with little external guidance available other than Epic's documentation.

- Enjoyed and had fun creating a spaceship

#### Room for improvement
- Add an algorithm that automatically stops the spaceship from rotating when no input is given.
- Improve the look of the thruster VFX when firing. 
- Make the HUD more 3d. 
- Add a selection of spaceships with different tunings.
- Add multiplayer.
## Media
